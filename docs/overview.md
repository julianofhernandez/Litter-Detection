Can I have a short summary of your study? What is the data, does it contain private identifiable info, are you also creating data that will be returned to Google? All the details.

For this study we will be using machine learning to recognize trash in Google Street View panoramas. The dataset includes approximately 143,000 pandormas with a resolution of 1664 x 832. These images have already been cleaned for personal identifiable information such as faces and license plates. Because of the size of the datset as well as the computational requirements to recognize objects in an image, we plan on using Amazon Web Services for storage and processing this data. The result of this processing will be a heat map of where trash within these areas is located similar to this map https://lahub.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=7279dc87ea9e416d9f90bf844505a54a. This map will be published in my study available publically, nothing will be sent back to Google. After the map is created the dataset will be deleted from Amazon Web Services.
